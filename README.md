# Resume
------------------
My resume as a Github page. The theme is based off the Jekyll [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme, modified for a single page static page, ideal for a resume or CV. 

## Convert to PDF
Use the ```make_pdf.py``` script to convert the html resume to a pdf. It requires jinja2, pdfkit and wkhtmltopdf, that can be installed by running the ```setup_libs.sh``` script.
