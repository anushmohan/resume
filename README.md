# Resume
------------------
My resume as a Github page. The theme is based off the Jekyll 
[Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme, modified for a single
page static page, ideal for a resume or CV. I've included a script
`topdf.py` that renders a pdf of the resume. It requires jinja2,
python-wkhtmltopdf and markdown2 python libraries. It renders a pdf 
version of your markdown resume, stylized by the provided template.
